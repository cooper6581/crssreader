* Fix a segfault when selecting a specific window at an index
* Instead of not redrawing while rss feeds are being reloaded, create
  a temporary rss_feed, load it, then copy it to the rss_window.  Then
  we would only not be redrawing during the copy, which should be
  pretty darn fast.
* test comment to see if git is working at it's new location
